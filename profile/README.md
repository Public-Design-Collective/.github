## Strengthening design practice in Latin America's public sector

A multi-level, open-source research repository documenting public-sector design, innovation labs, and design-informed governance across Latin America.

**Design** has the potential to transform how policies and services are imagined, built, and delivered—shifting innovation toward community-centered and institutionally grounded solutions.

We're a research initiative at **Northeastern University** making our datasets publicly available to advance research and practice in public sector design across Latin America.

This repository houses the datasets created through our ongoing, multi-phase research program.

**Status:**  
This repository is actively under development. Several components—including methodological documentation, interviews, survey instruments, and additional datasets—will be added as the research progresses.


## 💡 Our Research

The Public Design Collective explores how design can strengthen public policy and service innovation across Latin America. Our work examines:
- How design is integrated into public policy and governance
- Institutional capacity for sustaining design practice
- Regional approaches to public-sector innovation
- Strengths, barriers, and gaps within the ecosystem
- Longitudinal patterns in innovation labs and government design teams
