## Strengthening design practice in Latin America's public sector

A multi-level, open-source research repository documenting public-sector design, innovation labs, and design-informed governance across Latin America.

**Design** has the reshape and strengthen how policies and services are imagined, built, and delivered—shifting innovation toward community-centered and institutionally grounded solutions.

We're a research initiative at **Northeastern University** making our datasets publicly available to advance research and practice in public sector design across Latin America.

We are the **Public Design Collective**, a research initiative at Northeastern University examining how **design can transform public policy, services, and institutional innovation** across Latin America.

Design has the potential to reshape how governments imagine, build, and deliver public services—orienting innovation toward community-centered and evidence-informed solutions.
